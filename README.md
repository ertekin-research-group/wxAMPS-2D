# wxAMPS-2D
development 2D version of wxAMPS

wxAMPS-2D is based on wxAMPS Version 3
(see: https://wiki.illinois.edu//wiki/display/solarcellsim/Simulation+Software)
which is based on AMPS
(see: http://www.ampsmodeling.org/) 

The version under development here 
  - is extended to two dimensions 
  - replaces the finite time difference solver with a finite elements solver 
  
The original version, AMPS (Analysis of Microelectronic and Photonic Structures), was developed in the group of Stephen Fonash at Penn State University. wxAMPS has been under development by Angus Rockett and Yiming Liu at the University of Illinois.
